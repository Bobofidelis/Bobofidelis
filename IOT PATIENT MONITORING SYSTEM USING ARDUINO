HEALTH IS WEALTH. This is a popular saying that everyone knows unless you are still a suckling baby. In health institutions (hospitals, health centers ...), there are many instruments and tools used. One of this instruments is the patient monitoring system. This instrument monitors the patient vitals and gives prompt notification to the health officials.
	In this tutorial, we will be building a DIY IOT patient monitoring system that monitors the pulse rate of the patient, the temperature of the patient and the quality of the air surrounding the patient at a particular time and sends this information to the thingspeak platform. The thingspeak platform displays this readings in a graphical representation. It also sends a trigger to another platform for sending emails known as IFTTT. 
IFTTT is a networking platform that allows a user program different responses to events given them specific actions to perform.
Operation of the circuit
The circuit is around the Arduino board. The Ds18b20 temperature sensor, Mq135 gas sensor and the pulse rate sensor gets their values or sensor readings and this values are then sent to the Atmega328 microcontroller on the Arduino board. The system displays the readings on the LCD, It is also sends this values to the thingspeak platform using Wi-Fi module.
